# avanza-ynab-sync

Synchronize Avanza balance into a YNAB tracking account, given the below variables are saved into an `.env` file.

```
AZA_USERNAME=...
AZA_PASSWORD=...
AZA_TOTP_SECRET=...
YNAB_TOKEN=...
YNAB_BUDGET=...
YNAB_ACCOUNT=...
```

The `deploy.sh` will deploy the container to Google Cloud Run as a job.

NB. the job isn't automatically scheduled, do this yourself.

NB2. the .env file is not needed for deployment, the deploy script will ask for all relevant parameters and won't upload the env file into GCP.
